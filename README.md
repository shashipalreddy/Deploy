## How can we return the data from Controller to View 

 - we can do it using ViewBag, ViewData, ViewModel
 - Both ViewBag and ViewData doesn't provide compile time error checking.
 - ViewBag are stored as a name/value pair in ViewData dictionary internally.
 - It will be always a good practice to use strongly typed ViewModel over ViewData or ViewBag.
 
## what can't we return a ViewResult instead of Base Class ActionResult

 - Because controller can return more than just returning a view
